# Welcome ðŸ‘‹

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to format text easily using plain text syntax. It is widely used for writing documentation, blog posts, and even books. The key advantage of Markdown is that it's simple, readable, and can be converted to HTML or other formats with minimal effort.

In this article, we'll explore the essential features of Markdown by showcasing various text formatting options and elements.

---

## 1. Headings

Headings in Markdown are created by using the `#` symbol. The number of `#` symbols denotes the level of the heading, with one `#` for the largest heading and up to four `####` for the smallest heading.

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4

---

## 2. Emphasis

You can emphasize text by making it **bold**, *italic*, or ***bold and italic*** using the following syntax:

- **Bold**: Use `**text**` or `__text__`
- *Italic*: Use `*text*` or `_text_`
- ***Bold and italic***: Use `***text***` or `___text___`

**This is bold**  
*This is italic*  
***This is bold and italic***

## 3. Lists

### 3.1 Unordered Lists

To create unordered lists, use `-`, `+`, or `*` followed by a space:

- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Subitem 2.1
  - Subitem 2.2

### 3.2 Ordered Lists

Ordered lists are created by simply using numbers followed by periods (`1.`, `2.`, `3.`, etc.).

1. First item
2. Second item
   1. Subitem 2.1
   2. Subitem 2.2

## 4. Links

To add a link, you can use the following syntax: `[Link Text](URL)`.

You can insert images using similar syntax to links, but with an exclamation mark `!` in front: `![Alt Text](Image URL)`.

## 6. Blockquotes

Blockquotes are used to highlight quoted or important text. Start a line with `>` followed by a space.

> This is a blockquote.
> Blockquotes can span multiple lines.

---

## 7. Code

### 7.1 Inline Code

To include inline code, wrap the text in backticks (`).

Use `console.log()` in JavaScript to display output.

### 7.2 Code Blocks

For multi-line code blocks, use triple backticks (```), and optionally specify the language for syntax highlighting.

```js
const greet = (name) => {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
};
```

## 8. Horizontal rule

You can create horizontal lines or separators by using three or more dashes (---), asterisks (***), or underscores (___). Horizontal rules will result in a page break when printing.

---

## 9. Tables

Tables can be created using pipes (|) and dashes (-) to separate columns and rows.

| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Row 1    | Data 1   |
| Row 2    | Data 2   |
| Row 3    | Data 3   |
| Row 4    | Data 4   |
